# CardGame Project Documentation

## Project Context

This is a **Card Game Score Tracker** - a web application built with vanilla JavaScript for tracking scores and statistics in card games. The application allows users to create teams, manage matches, track round-by-round scores, and view comprehensive statistics. **The application now uses Firebase Firestore for real-time data synchronization and cloud storage.**

## Core Features

### Team Management
- Create teams with multiple members
- Track team statistics (wins, losses, draws, points)
- View team performance history
- Calculate win rates and recent form
- **Real-time updates across multiple clients**

### Match System
- Create matches between two teams
- Track round-by-round scoring
- Support for promise/actual scoring system
- Automatic match completion when score reaches 500
- Match history and activity tracking
- **Live synchronization of match updates**

### Statistics & Analytics
- Team rankings and leaderboards
- Individual match statistics
- Round-by-round analysis
- Performance trends and form tracking
- **Real-time statistics updates**

## Technical Architecture

### Data Models

#### Team Model (`js/models/Team.js`)
```javascript
class Team {
    constructor(id, name, members, createdAt)
    // Properties: id, name, members[], stats{}, matchHistory[]
    // Methods: updateStats(), getWinRate(), getRecentForm(), toJSON(), fromJSON()
}
```

#### Match Model (`js/models/Match.js`)
```javascript
class Match {
    constructor(id, team1Id, team2Id, date)
    // Properties: id, team1Id, team2Id, status, rounds[], finalScore{}, winnerId
    // Methods: addRound(), start(), complete(), cancel(), toJSON(), fromJSON()
}
```

## Data Flow

1. **Team Creation**: User creates team → Team model → Team service → Firebase Firestore → Real-time UI update
2. **Match Creation**: User selects teams → Match model → Match service → Firebase Firestore → Real-time UI update
3. **Round Scoring**: User enters scores → Match.addRound() → Firebase update → Real-time sync → Check for completion
4. **Statistics Update**: Match completion → Team.updateStats() → Firebase update → Real-time UI refresh
5. **Data Migration**: App loads → Check localStorage → Migrate to Firebase → Switch to cloud storage

## Key Business Rules

### Scoring System
- Each round has promise and actual scores for both teams
- Final score accumulates across rounds
- Match ends when either team reaches 500 points
- Winner is determined by first team to reach 500

### Team Statistics
- Win/Loss/Draw tracking
- Points system (3 for win, 1 for draw, 0 for loss)
- Round statistics (rounds won/lost)
- Performance against specific opponents
- **Real-time statistics synchronization**

### Data Persistence ⭐ UPDATED
- **Primary storage**: Firebase Firestore (cloud)
- **Backup storage**: Browser localStorage
- **Real-time synchronization** across multiple clients
- **Automatic data migration** from localStorage to Firebase
- **Offline support** with sync when connection restored

## Firebase Integration

```

### Real-time Features
- **Live team updates** across all connected clients
- **Real-time match synchronization** during gameplay
- **Instant statistics updates** when matches complete
- **Concurrent user support** with conflict resolution

### Security Rules
```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    match /teams/{document=**} {
      allow read, write: if true; // Development mode
    }
    match /matches/{document=**} {
      allow read, write: if true; // Development mode
    }
  }
}
```

## User Interface Patterns
